# Report of the tarot project

As its name suggests, the divinatory tarot is a form of cartomancia that has the particularity of using special cards to read the future. It helps clarify and helps to find the best solution to a given difficulty. The divinatory tarot is a divinatory art which uses the cards of the tarot of Marseilles.

The principle of the tarot is based on this: even if he ignores it, man holds in himself all the resources necessary to solve the problems of his life. Indeed, the human unconscious is much more powerful than one thinks, and contains all the answers to the concerns of existence. By the force of his unconscious, man thus proves to be omnipotent. It is the divine part that lives in each one, that knows all the answers and that, in fact, is symbolized by the soul.

## Analysis of the objective.

The goal is to create a tarot game in java language. First, you must be able to have control over the management of cards: add, search, modify and delete. 
This will require a graphical interface, with panels, buttons etc. 

At the divinatory tarot, there are several types of cards: the major arcanes and the minor arcanes. In our case, we will only use the major arcanes, which number 22.

These cards will be used to predict the playerâ€™s future. This is the principle of the divinatory tarot.

So, after having realized a system of cards, we will be able to read the future, thanks to the tarot cards. 

In general, the person seeking answers asks a question. The question must be precise and clear. After this question, the cards come into play. The person will draw 4 cards, this is called the cross draw. This is the most used print because it is the simplest.
